## Home Server
Yeah I am running a home server of sorts, as my fascination with Home Assistant, InfoSec, and networking/network security continues to grow.

Below is a list of the hardware I use for the rack. Click the details button to see the softare I am running on the network for server and IoT purposes.

- [CyberPower Smart App LCD UPS System, 1500VA/900W, 8 Outlets, AVR, 2U Rack Tower](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HDODQYS?psc=1)
  - Having battery backup is important. This way if there is a black or brownout, you have enough juice to keep your system running until you can shut it down properly.
- [CyberPower CPS1215RMS Surge Protector, 120V/15A, 12 Outlets, 15ft Power Cord, 1U Rackmount Black](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00077INZU?psc=1)
  - Ran out of outlets in the UPS
- [TP-Link 16 Port Gigabit Switch Smart Managed Switch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0797KPRPK?psc=1)
  - I have a couple of these TP-Link Switches, one unmanaged and another smaller managed switch. I want to separate different devices on different networks using a VLAN and other things.
- [NavePoint 9U Wall Mount Network Server 19 Inch IT Cabinet Rack Enclosure Glass Door Lock](https://www.amazon.com/NavePoint-Network-Server-Cabinet-Enclosure/dp/B01FKOW4LS/144-7175663-3493110?psc=1)
  - This is where I hold all the rack equipment
- [Synology 4 bay NAS DiskStation DS920+ Diskless 4-bay; 4GB DDR4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087Z34F3R?psc=1)
  - I *love* this thing. I have Homebridge running on it, I have Plex serving up stuff on it, and a dev instance of Home Assistant as well as a few Docker containers. Trying to figure out how to deploy a production app in a container[^4] and am using this to test out a few containers with small node apps in them.
- [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (8gb)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08R87H4RR?psc=1)
  - I have a production Home Assistant instance running on this.
- [CanaKit Raspberry Pi 3 B+](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Premium-Clear-Supply/dp/B07BC7BMHY)
  - I am running Pi-hole and WireGuard on this however I don't understand most of how Wireguard works so I bought a Swiss VPN with no ties to any government          
- [Intel NUC BXKit10i3 Home & Business Mini Desktop Black with Hub](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09DCZQFF2?psc=1)
  - Moving Home Assistant to this as it is more powerful which means faster automations and load times.
- [Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro](https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-unifi-os-consoles/products/udm-pro)
  - Running a little server farm in here so why not.

## I Use a lot of software, I admit

But I use ALL OF IT.

So this is my setup and what I am currently using. You can show me your dev setup on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@tiff).
